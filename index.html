            <h4>Small Business Owner</h4>
            <p class="lead">The typical small business owner often does not have the resources to invest in a regular emergency messaging system. However, when a flood happens, it’s difficult to reach all employees, making the process of communication painful and inefficient. By creating a system that centralizes all communications in one easy, accessible and affordable app, we are allowing small business owners to minimize inefficiencies, save time and resources.</p>

BPress cuts through the red tape and allows managers to set up a system within minutes with the tools they are already using to manage their employees.</p>

By providing with a system that allows quick employee check-ins, employees can keep up to date with their managers and get back to work safely and efficiently.</p>
